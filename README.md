# Real-Time-Color-Detection-and-Tracking-using-OpenCV
This Python project performs real-time color detection and tracking using a webcam feed.
It leverages OpenCV to convert frames into the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space, allowing users to dynamically adjust the color detection range through interactive trackbars.

The application displays:

The original camera feed

The mask showing detected pixels of the selected color

The result window highlighting only the detected color in the live video

You can tune color ranges manually to detect any color in real time, or preset common colors like red, green, or blue.
This project is perfect for beginners exploring computer vision, image masking, and OpenCV GUI features.
