# Real-Time-Color-Detection-and-Tracking-using-OpenCV
This Python project performs real-time color detection and tracking using a webcam feed. It leverages OpenCV to convert frames into the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space, allowing users to dynamically adjust the color detection range through interactive trackbars.
